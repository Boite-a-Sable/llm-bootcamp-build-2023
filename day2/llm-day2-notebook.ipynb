For this lab, we will finetune a 7b llama2 model using LoRA on a single A10 GPU. This also demostrates how good the inference can be on finetuned models even with limited compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're also passing `train_dataset` and `eval_dataset` that are used to generate loss calculation along the way. And for `train`, `output_weights_dir` is the directory where the finetune weights are stored after training completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For configuration, for quick illustration, we will just set `max_steps`=1 with 4bit quantization. Quantization is required to train on single A10.  To achieve good performance for the task, you will need at least 1 `num_epochs`, feel free to explore that on your own."
