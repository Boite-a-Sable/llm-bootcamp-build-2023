    "Fine-tuning is one form of model training. We start training from a pre-trained model and adjust a set of model parameters to better solve for a concrete task based on task specific data. Today we are going to fine-tune 7B Llama 2 model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)--which is a parameter efficient way of fine-tuning LLM. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of adjusting all the ~7B parameters, LoRA allows us to adjust only a percent of model weights--which can save compute and memory resources dramatically. For this lab, we will fine-tune our model using LoRA on a single A10 GPU. This will demostrate how good the inference can be on fine-tuned models even with limited compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "We're passing `train_dataset` and `eval_dataset` that are used to generate loss calculation during fine-tuning process and we've set `output_weights_dir` as the directory where the fine-tuned weights will be stored after fine-tuning job completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're also setting `max_steps=1` with 4bit quantization. Quantization is required to train on single A10 GPU. To achieve good performance for the task, you will need at least 1 `num_epochs`, feel free to explore this on your own."
